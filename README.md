# Modern Hardware Simulation - MHS

## Introduction
Modern Hardware Simulation (MHS) is a hardware description and simulation language that allows users to simulate the behavior of a hardware system in a easy, intuitive and fast way. The language is designed to be a C-like user-friendly. It describes the hardware components very more accurate to the logic gate design than others languages like VHDL.
